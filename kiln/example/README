Example Application
===================

The following documentation is specifically for setting up and using
the example Kiln application, and is in addition to the more general
Kiln documentation.

The example site is an adaptation (with reduced functionality and
content) of the eREED project (http://ereed.cch.kcl.ac.uk/), and makes
use of the TEI content and code of that project.


Installation and setup
----------------------

* Copy all of the files in this directory into the webapps directory,
  replacing any existing files with the same paths.

* Create a new Sesame RDF repository at /openrdf-workbench/ with the
  ID "test".

* Run the webserver and go to /admin/xml/ and harvest and index all of
  the documents.

Note that this example site does depend on core Kiln files not
provided in this directory but in the main distribution (the webapps
directory)
