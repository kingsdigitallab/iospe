                        <div>
                            <p>This is the first electronic edition of inscriptions from
                                Borysthenes, an ancient Greek settlement on the island of Berezan, located in the Dnipro-Buh delta, 
                                in modern Ukraine: https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/226545.
                                 In antiquity, this piece of land was a promontory connected to the mainland, and it shows the first traces of ancient 
                                Greek presence in the 7th century BCE, making it one of the earliest Greek sites in the Black Sea.
                                </p>
                            <p>The site has been excavated since ca. 1900 by archaeological teams from various institutions, first in tsarist Russia, then in the Soviet Union, 
                            and following the dissolution of the latter in 1991, from Ukraine, and Russian Federation. As a result of the complex history of 
                            excavations and due to geopolitical changes over time, material from the site ended up in several museums and repositories in Ukraine and the Russian Federation.
                            The vast majority of inscriptions from Borysthenes (Berezan) are graffiti and dipinti on pottery. The importance of ceramic supports for the organization of the 
                            corpus justifies publication of collections of each museum's and repository's collection separately (Parts 1 - 4), similarly to the approach adopted in the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum. 
                           This approach also recognizes separate authority of specific national institutions responsible for heritage managemeent in each case. A tables of Contents is provided
                           for each Part, and at the same time, following standard epigraphic conventions, a Unified Table of Contents for the volume (II) fascicle (1), representing the 
                            geographic area of Borysthenes as a whole, is made available, which means that the Tables of Contents from each Part are combined to present an overall picture.
                            At the same time, faceted search capability of the database allows selections of lemmata to be made according to researchers' individual interests.</p>
                            <p>The introduction, epigraphic editions and commentaries are by Irene
                                POLINSKAYA. The inscriptions were encoded following the EpiDoc
                                Guidelines for use of XML for ancient documentary editions, and the
                                website and supporting materials are the work of Gabriel BODARD,
                                Irene POLINSKAYA and colleagues at the Department of Digital
                                Humanities and King’s Digital Lab, King's College London.</p>

                            <p>The groupping of inscriptions in this volume is based on the identification of Categories of Text and, for texts on ceramic supports,
                                 on the identification of stages in the life cycle of pottery. Detailed principles of corpus structure
                                are presented in the Introduction. 
                              Inscriptions are also accessible via <ref
