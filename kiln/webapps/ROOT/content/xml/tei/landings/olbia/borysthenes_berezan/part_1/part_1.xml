                            <p>The autopsy and study of the material were conducted between 2016 and 2019 with the permission of the museum, and access to the collection
                                was made possible by its former keeper Sergey Solovyov. The introduction, epigraphic editions, commentaries, and metadata descriptions  
                                are by Irene POLINSKAYA. Information on Find Contexts derives from inventory cards of the Berezan collection 
                                at the State Hermitage Museum.</p>
                            <p>The identification and dating of ceramics were made, primarily, by Sergey SOLOVYOV (former Keeper of the Berezan Collection, The State Hermitage Museum)
                                in 2017 and 2019.</p>
                            <p>The inscriptions were encoded following the EpiDoc Guidelines for use of XML for ancient documentary editions.
                               The website and supporting materials are the work of Gabriel BODARD, Irene POLINSKAYA and colleagues at the Department of Digital
                               Humanities and King’s Digital Lab, King's College London.</p>
                            <p>Images are based on hand drawings made by Irene POLINSKAYA de visu in 2017-2019. They were converted into digital files by Olena SHEVCHENKO. Photographs
                            of the objects were also made by Irene POLINSKAYA at the time of autopsy, and access to them can be requested by contacting the author. Implementation
                            of a collaborative agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) between King's College London and the State Hermitage Museum was interrupted in early 2022, 
                            following the outbreak of the war, complicating the completion of this publication.
